Repository Title: DDoS Attack Detection with CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model

Description:

This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive study on detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in network traffic using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model. The project focuses on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, specifically its Friday subset, which provides a realistic and diverse set of benign and DDoS traffic samples.

Key Features:

 CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model:
       Novel architecture combining CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for temporal modeling.
       Designed to capture complex patterns and relationships within network traffic data for accurate DDoS detection.
 Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
       Handles missing values, label encoding, and feature scaling for optimal model performance.
       Groups features into meaningful categories and reshapes data into 2D grids for CNN input.
 Baseline Models:
       Compares the CNN-LSTM model to a range of traditional and deep learning models:
           Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, SVM, KNN, 1D CNN, 2D CNN
 Evaluation:
       Rigorous evaluation on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC.
       Confusion matrices and ROC curve analysis provide detailed insights into model performance.

Results:

   The CNN-LSTM model demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models, achieving high accuracy and low false positive/negative rates.
   The hybrid architecture effectively captures both spatial and temporal patterns in network traffic, leading to more accurate DDoS detection.

Potential Applications:

   Real-time DDoS attack detection and mitigation in network security systems.
   Identification of emerging attack patterns and improvement of existing detection mechanisms.
   Contribution to the advancement of machine learning-based cybersecurity solutions.
